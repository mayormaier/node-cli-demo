# node-cli-demo

Shamelessly taken from [this fireship tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oHByo8tiEY) regarding how to publish node packages as npx executables in the command line.

Uses a handful of helpful and cool cli packages, like:

- chalk
- chalk-animation
- figlet
- gradient-string
- inquirer
- nanospinner

## Usage

```bash
npx mayormaier-node-cli-demo
```

npm package available here [https://www.npmjs.com/package/mayormaier-node-cli-demo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mayormaier-node-cli-demo)
