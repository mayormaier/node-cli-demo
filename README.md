# node-cli-demo

Shamelessly taken from [this fireship tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oHByo8tiEY) regarding how to publish node packages as npx executables in the command line.

Uses a handful of helpful and cool cli packages, like:

- chalk
- chalk-animation
- figlet
- gradient-string
- inquirer
- nanospinner
